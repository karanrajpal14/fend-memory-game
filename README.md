# Memory Game Project

A typical memory game that consists of a 4X4 grid of FontAwesome icons. Has basic functionality such as:

- Keeping track of the number of moves
- Displaying a star rating depending on the number of moves
- A timer to track the time it takes to complete the game
- An option to reset the game

This is the second project for Udacity's Frontend Developer Nanodegree and was built as to amalgamate the skills learned thus far.
